/**
 * stellar-agent-guard-sdk — the public surface.
 *
 * An integration bridge between AI agent frameworks and `stellar-agent-guard`
 * smart accounts: pre-flight policy interception, agent-auth transaction
 * signing, and on-chain event telemetry.
 *
 * **Enforcement scope, stated where the capability is claimed:** full
 * recipient/amount enforcement — spend caps, allowlists, per-transaction limits
 * — is native and automatic for SAC token transfers (`transfer`/`transfer_from`),
 * since these are the calls whose arguments the Soroban auth context exposes for
 * inspection. For other Soroban contract calls made by the guarded account
 * (arbitrary DEX/lending/protocol calls), the policy engine still enforces window
 * and pause state, but per-call amount/recipient limits are not yet enforced —
 * extending fine-grained enforcement to arbitrary calls is tracked as a v2 item,
 * not implied as already covered.
 *
 * This sentence is copied verbatim from the contracts repo's
 * `docs/enforcement-scope.md` ("The confirmed scope"), not paraphrased: the
 * boundary is a property of the platform, and stating it in one shared wording
 * is what keeps the two repos from drifting apart on it.
